# Word Count

## Description

This project is a web (front-end) application written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org).

It contains a form, in which the user can input some text.<br /> 

Once submitted, the app counts the number of words in the input and displays it.<br /> 

However, if the input is empty/blank, it will display an error message, saying the user cannot input an empty text.

It is deployed through Vercel [here](https://word-count-pi.vercel.app).
