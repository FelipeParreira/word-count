## Description

This programming challenge should take around 1-3 hours, and can be done anytime prior to the interview.

The task is to create a user-facing form that counts the number of words in a block of text.

## Acceptance Criteria:

As a user<br>
  * when I view the application
    then I see a form containing a text box to enter a body of text;

  * and when I submit the form with some text
    then I see a result containing the number of words in the text box;

  * and when I submit the form with an empty text
    then I see a form error telling me that some text input is required.

As an engineer:<br>
  * when I look at your project
    then I should understand how to install and run it.<br>

The form can be delivered as a web page or mobile app. The word counting function(s) can be implemented in whatever language or framework you prefer.

You may use any third-party libraries or packages that you need to.

You may consult with all of the usual resources that you use in your usual work: documentation, Stack Overflow, tutorials, etc.

If there are limitations/known issues/todo's, comment them and be prepared to explain. 

This program will not be perfect and cover every edge case due to the time constraint. This exercise is as much about trade-offs as it is about code.

Feel free to make assumptions about the scope and requirements if not explicitly mentioned in the acceptance criteria. (In other words, just go for it!)
